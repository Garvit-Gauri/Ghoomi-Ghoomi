    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Exemplifying the formative stage of the Mughal structural style, Humayun's Tomb stands as a landmark in the development of Mughal architecture, and also represents the earliest extant specimen of the Mughal scheme of the garden tomb, with causeways and channels. It is a well-developed specimen of the double-domed elevation with kiosks on a grand scale. This building tradition culminated in the Taj Mahal, constructed a century later. Despite being the first standardized example of this style, Humayun's Tomb is an architectural achievement of the highest order.

        The tomb of Humayun, second Mughal Emperor of India, was built by his widow, Biga Begum (Hajji Begum), in 1569-70, 14 years after his death, at a cost of 1.5 million rupees. The architect was Mirak Mirza Ghiyath. It was later used for the burial of various members of the ruling family and contains some 150 graves. It has aptly been described as the necropolis of the Mughal dynasty. </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p> This fine mausoleum was built near River Yamuna by Emperor Humayun’s first wife Begum Bega aka Haji Begum to immortalize the memory of her husband. Though the Emperor died in 1556, it wasn’t until 1565 that the construction for the monument began. After seven years of construction, the tomb and the surrounding Charbagh Garden were completed in 1572. Given the grandeur of the memorial, it’s no surprise that the construction cost came to 1.5 million rupees, which was completely borne by Begum Bega.

        Over the centuries, Humayun’s Tomb witnessed much neglect and decline. In the 18th-century, the beautiful gardens surrounding the monument gave way to vegetable gardens. After the colonial rulers took over Delhi, the Charbagh Garden was overlaid with an English-style garden in 1860. However, in the early part of the 20th-century, the tomb complex was restored with the original gardens at the order of Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India.
