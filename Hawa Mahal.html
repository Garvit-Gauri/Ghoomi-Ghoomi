    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> 
        The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the palace enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally translates into the “Palace of the Winds”.


        The main purpose behind the construction of this palace was to allow the ladies of the royal family and the court to observe the busy streets of the Johari Bazaar from the many jharokhas of the palace, without being seen themselves. The Hawa Mahal is a five-storey building, and it is the tallest building in the world that has been built without a foundation. It has a curved architecture that leans at an 87 degree angle, and a pyramidal shape which has helped it stay erect for centuries.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p> 
        It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh for the court harem so that they could witness the royal processions and the street life. The exquisite pink and red sandstone ‘mahal’ stands out for its striking architecture, and the beautiful ‘jhaali’ works on its 953 windows.

        Known as Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh’s favourite resort, the palace was designed by an architect named Lal Chand Usta. The Hawa Mahal architecture is defined by its five-story tiered shape that rises to about 50 feet. The elevated facade resembles a honeycomb with small portholes, each with miniature windows, carved sandstone grills, and finials. The interior however consists of minimalistic decorative elements as compared to its gaudy exteriors.

        The Hawa Mahal architectural style is an incredible amalgamation of Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal-influenced designs. Its interiors are composed of large chambers with different coloured marbles, inlaid panels and glidings. Its entry is through a large imperial door that leads to a fountain-laden courtyard, enclosed by double-storied buildings. Every floor of Hawa Mahal has a temple.
