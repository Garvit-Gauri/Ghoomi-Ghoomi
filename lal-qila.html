    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Red Fort served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for many years. It is a symbol of India's rich cultural and historical heritage.
        The Red Fort, or Lal Qila, stands as an architectural marvel and a profound symbol of India's historical narrative. Commissioned by the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, construction of the fort commenced in 1638 and concluded in 1648. Designed by the master architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the fort is a testament to the grandeur of Mughal architecture, showcasing an exquisite blend of Persian, Timurid, and Indian influences. The fort derives its name from the colossal red sandstone walls that envelop its vast expanse, providing an imposing and regal facade.
        
        Throughout its nearly 400 years of existence, the Red Fort has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, serving as the epicenter of Mughal power during its heyday. It functioned as the principal residence of Mughal emperors for approximately 200 years, witnessing the reigns of Shah Jahan and his successors. The fort's historical significance extends to pivotal moments in India's colonial history, as it became a symbol of resistance during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against British rule.
        
        The Red Fort has hosted historic events that resonate in the collective memory of the nation. Notably, it was the site where Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, hoisted the national flag on August 15, 1947, marking the country's independence from British rule. This annual tradition continues to this day, making the Red Fort the focal point of India's Independence Day celebrations.
        
        Despite facing the ravages of time, the Red Fort remains a living testament to the cultural and architectural legacy of the Mughal era. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, the fort continues to captivate visitors with its ornate structures, lush gardens, and evocative historical aura. Today, as one explores the intricate chambers, grand halls, and majestic gateways of the Red Fort, each step resonates with the echoes of centuries past, encapsulating the spirit of a bygone era within its resilient walls.</p>
