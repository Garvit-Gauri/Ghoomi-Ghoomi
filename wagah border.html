    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Wagah Border is the international border separating India and Pakistan. This border is important from the perspective of history and the splendid military ceremony that takes place everyday, which attracts a large number of tourists.

Wagah Border is an army outpost lying on the India-Pakistan border.
This Border was used by the migrants to cross the border at the time of independence in 1947.
Wagah Border is located at a distance of 32 kms from Amritsar, Punjab.
This border derives its name from Wagah, a village which is located in the Punjab province of Pakistan.
It lies on the famous Grand Trunk Road connecting the cities of Amritsar (Punjab, India) and Lahore (Pakistan).
This place is famous for the Wagah Border Ceremony, also known as Beating Retreat Border Ceremony.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The border crossing draws its name from Wahga village, near which the Radcliffe Line, the boundary demarcation line dividing India and Pakistan upon the Partition of British India, was drawn.At the time of the independence in 1947, migrants from India entered Pakistan through this border crossing and vice versa. The Wagah railway station is 400 metres (1,300 ft) to the south and 100 metres (330 ft) from the border. The Wagah-Attari border ceremony happens at the border gate, two hours before sunset each day. The flag ceremony is conducted by the Pakistan Rangers and Indian Border Security Force (BSF), similar to the retreat ceremonies at Ganda Singh Wala/Hussainiwala border crossing and Mahavir/Sadqi International Parade Ground border crossing. A marching ceremony, known as the "Silly Walk ceremony", is conducted each evening along with the flag ceremony. The ceremony started in 1986 as an agreement of peace, although there was not a conflict at that time. Other Middle East nations have adopted similar ceremonies in recent years.
