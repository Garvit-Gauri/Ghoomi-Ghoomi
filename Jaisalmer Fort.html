    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Jaisalmer Fort is situated in the city of Jaisalmer, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is one of the very few "living forts" in the world (such as Carcassonne, France), as nearly one fourth of the old city's population still resides within the fort. For the better part of its 860-year history, the fort was the city of Jaisalmer. The first settlements outside the fort walls, to accommodate the growing population of Jaisalmer, are said to have come up in the 17th century.

Jaisalmer Fort is the second oldest fort in Rajasthan, built in 1156 AD by the Rawal (ruler) Jaisal from whom it derives its name, and stood at the crossroads of important trade routes (including the ancient Silk road).

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Jaisalmer Fort is celebrated for its impressive history and has witnessed many battles with Mughals, Tughalaqs, Khiljis and Rathore Kings. The fort was built by Raja Rawal Jaisal in 1156 AD. However, a fortified defence structure called Rang Burj was added to it in 1276 AD by Rawal Jethsi after two invasions by the Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khilji.

Sultan Alauddin Khilji’s army surrounded the fort for about 8-9 years. After repeated attempts, the Sultan succeeded in capturing Jaisalmer Fort from the Bhati Rajputs in 1294. This forced around 25,000 women to commit jauhar or self-immolation to protect their honour.

After keeping possession of the fort for about two years, Khilji’s army abandoned the castle. It was inhabited again by the surviving Bhatis later and over time the kingdom regained its former glory.

The fort witnessed another jauhar in the late 14th-century when Delhi’s Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq attacked Jaisalmer.

Jaisalmer Fort was attacked once again in 1541 by Humayun during the reign of Rawal Lunakaran. Rawal’s defiance was broken and he was forced to give his daughter’s hand in marriage to Akbar, Humayun’s son and successor. The fort was controlled by the Mughal rulers till 1762 until Maharawal Mulraj took over it, who eventually entered into a treaty with the British East India Company. This made Jaisalmer one of the most important princely states in Rajasthan. But the city joined the Union of India after the country won its independence.

At one point, this massive fort has also served as a residence for the entire population of Jaisalmer. It was an important trade and business stop in medieval times until the British invasion.
